title: Collected Paintings Album
---

Recently, I am reading <What Are You Looking At?: 150 Years of Modern Art in the Blink of an Eye>. It's an interesting book. However, most of the paintings mentioned in the book are not given. I spent a lot of time searching and finding good quality photos. I upload my results to this [album](https://www.douban.com/photos/album/1655783716/). Wish others can save time and have a more enjoyable reading experience.
